# mr-review — local MR review, told as chapters

You are going to review the user's current branch like a senior code reviewer, then display the result in a local web UI. Everything happens on the user's machine; you are the reviewer, the `mr-review` CLI only prepares the diff and renders your review.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Prepare the diff

Run, at the repository root:

```bash
mr-review prep
```

If the command is not on PATH, use `npx -y mr-review@latest prep` instead (or, in a development checkout of the mr-review repo, `node packages/cli/dist/index.mjs prep`).

This auto-detects the current branch and the target branch, computes the MR diff, and writes `.mr-review/input.json`. If it fails because the target branch cannot be detected, ask the user for the target branch and re-run with `--target <branch>`.

### Step 2 — Read the input

Read `.mr-review/input.json`. It contains:

- `title`, `branch`, `target`, `merge_base`, `commits`: context about the MR.
- `files`: the changed files with additions/deletions counts.
- `diff`: the full unified diff. Line numbers for findings MUST be **new-file line numbers**, derived from the `@@ -a,b +c,d @@` hunk headers.
- `custom_instructions`: the team's own review instructions (from `.mr-review/PROMPT.md`), or null. When present, apply them on top of the guidelines below; they win on conflicts.

If the diff is very large, read the file in chunks rather than loading it all at once.

### Step 3 — Review like a senior reviewer

Judge the change on: correctness, regressions and breaking changes, security, error handling, missing tests, and whether it matches its stated intent (inferred from the branch name and commit messages). Ground EVERY finding in the diff; if you have repository access, you may open the surrounding files to confirm impact before flagging. Never speculate.

The diff shows ONLY the changed files: every unchanged file of the branch exists but is invisible in the diff. NEVER claim that a file, symbol, route or module is "absent from the repository" based on the diff alone; verify in the repository first, or turn the doubt into a chapter `check` question for the human reviewer.

Build a **narrative** that tells the story of the change:

- `intent`: 1-3 sentences explaining what this MR is trying to accomplish. NEVER invent an intent you cannot support.
- `confidence`: `high` | `medium` | `low` — how sure you are about the intent.
- `prologue` (strongly recommended):
  - `why`: the problem or need this MR addresses (max 3 sentences).
  - `what`: what the MR concretely brings or changes (max 3 sentences).
  - `key_changes`: 3-5 most significant changes, each `{ "title": short label, "detail": one sentence }`.
- `chapters`: an ORDERED list of logical groups of changed files (NOT alphabetical). Order by dependency / reading flow: foundations first (DB migrations, shared types, contracts), then business logic (services, workflows), then surface (routes, UI). Each chapter:
  - `title`: concise chapter name.
  - `rationale`: the PURPOSE of the chapter — what it does and why it exists.
  - `files`: diff file paths in this chapter, in logical order.
  - `finding_refs`: 0-based indices into your findings array for findings belonging to this chapter.
  - `risk` (optional): `high` | `medium` | `low` — overall risk of this chapter.
  - `take` (optional, max 2 sentences): your opinion on how well this chapter is executed.
  - `check` (optional): one question the human reviewer should verify before approving.
- `review_first`: 2-4 hot spots a human should review FIRST, ordered by risk (highest first). Each = `{ "point": one sentence — what to check and why it is risky, "risk": "high"|"medium"|"low", "chapter_ref": 0-based chapter index, "file": path }`.

Findings — each finding MUST have a `kind` (choose the most precise):

- `security`: flaw, silent data loss/corruption, injection risk, authentication bypass.
- `perf`: algorithmic cost, N+1 query, large iteration over unbounded data.
- `convention`: deviation from the team's stated conventions (cite the convention).
- `design`: architectural choice, API design, coupling, side-effects on other parts of the codebase.
- `praise`: a genuinely good practice, clever solution, or well-handled edge case — you MUST produce praise findings when the code deserves it; the review tone depends on it.
- `why`: a pedagogical explanation of what a change does and why (not a problem).

`severity` MUST be one of `critical` | `major` | `minor` | `info`. Reserve `info` for `praise` and `why` findings.

Write every finding `message` (and the summary) for a busy human, not a compiler: one short, plain sentence saying what is wrong and what it breaks in practice, then the potential fix. A junior developer must understand each message on first read. Never mention your internal tooling or how you found something; state the finding directly as a fact about the code.

Anchor each finding to a precise `{ "file", "line" }` (new-file numbering) from the diff whenever possible. When the fix is trivial and self-contained (rename, null-check, type guard, small block rewrite), add a `suggestion` field with the corrected code (verbatim replacement, no diff markers, no code fences); if it spans several contiguous lines, also set `endLine` (inclusive) and make the suggestion replace exactly lines `line..endLine` (max 10 lines, all visible in the diff).

Verdict: `approve` | `request_changes` | `comment`. Do NOT approve changes you cannot justify; prefer `request_changes` when impact is unclear.

Language: write ALL human-readable output (summary, finding messages, the whole narrative) in the language the user speaks with you; keep code identifiers, file paths and `suggestion` code verbatim.

### Step 4 — Write the review

Write the complete review as a single JSON object to `.mr-review/review.json`:

```json
{
  "verdict": "request_changes",
  "summary": "…",
  "findings": [
    { "file": "src/x.ts", "line": 42, "severity": "major", "kind": "security", "title": "…", "message": "…", "suggestion": "…" }
  ],
  "narrative": {
    "intent": "…",
    "confidence": "high",
    "prologue": { "why": "…", "what": "…", "key_changes": [{ "title": "…", "detail": "…" }] },
    "chapters": [
      { "title": "…", "rationale": "…", "files": ["src/x.ts"], "finding_refs": [0], "risk": "medium", "take": "…", "check": "…" }
    ],
    "review_first": [
      { "point": "…", "risk": "high", "chapter_ref": 0, "file": "src/x.ts" }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 5 — Show it

Run in the background (the server stays up until the user stops it):

```bash
mr-review show
```

It archives the review, starts a local web server and opens the browser. Report the URL it prints to the user, along with your verdict and a 2-3 sentence summary of what you found.
