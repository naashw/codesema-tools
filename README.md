**Review your merge requests locally, with the AI agent you already use.**

Run one command on a branch: `codesema` computes the MR diff, hands it to **your** AI agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, …), and opens a local web UI where the review appears live. You then read it like a guided tour: what to look at first, step by step, with findings pinned to the diff.

- **Your agent, your subscription.** The review runs through the agent CLI you already pay for. No account, no API key, no cloud: everything happens on your machine.
- **Zero runtime dependencies.** `npm install codesema` installs exactly one package, shipped unminified so you can audit the code that reads your diff.

## Quick start

```bash
npx -y codesema
```

That is the whole flow:

1. **First run only**: a short wizard asks which agent CLI to use (auto-detected on your PATH), the model and the reasoning effort. Saved globally, never asked again; change it anytime with `codesema config`.
2. **Pick a branch**: your local branches, sorted by last commit, arrow keys + type-to-filter.
3. **The web UI opens immediately**: the review runs in the background and the page fills in live, diff stats first, then verdict, summary and findings as the agent writes them (true token streaming with Claude Code, best-effort with other agents).

Re-running on the same branch reviews **incrementally**: the agent gets the previous review plus the diff since it, and updates it (pass `--full` to review from scratch).

## How it works

```
┌──────────────┐  prep   ┌───────────────────────┐  review   ┌───────────────────────┐  live SSE
│ local branch │ ──────► │ .codesema/input.json  │ ────────► │ .codesema/review.json │ ─────────► local web UI
└──────────────┘  (CLI)  └───────────────────────┘ (your AI  └───────────────────────┘ (opened before
                                                     agent)                             the review ends)
```

1. **prep** detects the target branch (via `glab`/`gh` if an MR/PR exists, else `origin/HEAD`, else nearest merge-base among develop/main/master) and computes the MR diff.
2. **Your agent** reviews the diff like a senior reviewer and writes a structured review: prologue, ordered steps with risk/take/check, typed findings (security/perf/convention/design/praise/why), and what to review first.
3. **The local web UI** shows the review in progress, then switches to the full experience: guided step-by-step reading, split/unified diff with inline notes, file tree, read/checked progress.

## Requirements

- Node.js ≥ 20 and `git`
- An AI agent CLI: `claude` (Claude Code), `codex` (OpenAI) and `gemini` (Google) are auto-detected; anything else works via the "Custom command" wizard option or `--agent '<cmd>'` (e.g. `--agent 'opencode run "$(cat)"'`)
- Optional: `glab` or `gh` on the PATH, to auto-detect the target branch from the open MR/PR

## Configuration

```bash
npx -y codesema config
```

Interactive: language → agent → model → effort, then where to save. Two levels, field by field:

| Level  | File                             | When                                   |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Global | `~/.config/codesema/config.json` | Your default, every repo (onboarding)  |
| Repo   | `.codesema/config.json`          | Team/project override, wins over global |

CLI flags always win over both. `target`, `port`, `timeout` and `language` can also be set in either file.

### Language

Onboarding starts with a language question, stored as `language` (ISO 639-1: `en` or `fr`). It drives the CLI output, the web UI and the language the agent writes the review in. Without it, the interface stays in English and the review follows the language of the commit messages.

`review` and `show` check the npm registry once at startup (a read-only `dist-tags` lookup, nothing about you or your code is sent) to print a one-line notice when a newer version exists. Set `CODESEMA_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to disable it; it is also skipped when stdout is not a terminal.

### Repo-provided agent approval

An `agent` command coming from a repo's `.codesema/config.json` runs on your machine, in your shell. codesema asks for a one-time approval per repo (remembered in your global config) and asks again whenever the command changes. Non-interactive runs refuse an unapproved repo agent: approve it once in a terminal, or pass `--agent '<cmd>'` explicitly.

## Commands

```bash
codesema                       # interactive terminal: opens a navigable menu (review, show, sync, link, config)
codesema review --branch feat/x --target develop   # non-interactive, CI-friendly
codesema config                # change language / agent / model / effort
codesema prep                  # only write .codesema/input.json for your own agent flow
codesema show                  # only display .codesema/review.json (or the last archived review)
codesema export --out review.md   # Markdown export (--out - for stdout)
codesema sync                  # push the latest review to a free anonymous codesema.com workspace
codesema sync delete           # erase all synced data and local credentials
codesema link <code>           # attach the workspace to a codesema.com account via a pairing code
```

Sync is opt-in and free; your review record (including the diff) is only sent when you run `codesema sync`.

`codesema --help` lists every flag.

## Agent skill (optional)

To drive the flow from inside your agent instead of the CLI, install the bundled skill (plain agent-agnostic markdown):

```bash
# Claude Code, from a clone of this repo (global install):
cp -r skills/codesema ~/.claude/skills/codesema
```

Then, in any repo, on your feature branch, ask your agent: `/codesema`. It uses `codesema prep` + `codesema show` underneath.

## Customize

- `.codesema/PROMPT.md`: your team's review instructions, merged into the agent prompt.
- `.codesema-ignore`: glob patterns excluded from the diff (lockfiles, minified files and sourcemaps are excluded by default).

## Troubleshooting

- `could not detect the target branch`: no MR/PR found and no develop/main/master to compare against; pass `--target <branch>`.
- `empty diff … nothing to review`: codesema reviews **committed** work, commit your changes first.
- `agent timed out`: raise the budget with `--timeout <seconds>` (default 900).
- `no supported agent CLI found`: install `claude`, or pick "Custom command" in `codesema config` (the command receives the prompt on stdin and must print the review JSON on stdout).
- Port busy: codesema scans 20 ports from the preferred one (default 4400); pick another base with `--port <n>`.
- The web page says the review failed: the terminal has the full error; the server stays up so you can read both.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun run build        # builds the web UI, embeds it in the CLI, builds the CLI
node packages/cli/dist/index.mjs        # full interactive flow
node packages/cli/dist/index.mjs show
```

Monorepo layout (`codesema-tools`): `packages/cli` (Node CLI: review/prep/show, native `node:http` ephemeral server + SSE, zero runtime dependencies), `packages/web` (Vue 3 + Vite SPA embedded in the CLI tarball), `skills/codesema` (the agent skill).
